    "+ Bike Sharing Systems (BSS) have a very widely used method of transportation for many people worldwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ They have several advantages:\n",
    "    + Non-polluting.\n",
    "    + Circumvents traffic congestion.\n",
    "    + Excellent for last-mile connections.\n",
    "    + Have a convenient payment system."

    "+ Not all stations have an equal amount of demand at any given time of the day.\n",
    "+ Companies responsible for BSSs conduct periodic re-positions of bikes from low demand to high demand stations.\n",
    "+ Companies need to have knowledge which stations have an excess of bikes and which requires them the most.\n"
