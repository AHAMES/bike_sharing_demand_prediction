# Project Description

## Introduction

+ Bike Sharing Systems (BSS) is a very widely used method of transportation for many people worldwide.

+ They have several advantages:
    + Non-polluting.
    + Circumvents traffic congestion.
    + Excellent for last-mile connections.
    + Have a convenient payment system.

## Motivation
<center>
![](images/moving_truck.jpg){width=380px}
</center>

+ BSSs use self-serve bikes locked to docking stations.
+ Bikes are unlocked, used for a trip, then left at the closest station to their destination.
+ Bikes need to be relocated from low demand to high demand stations.


## Problem Definition
+ The relocation process could be costly and time consuming.
+ Stations with high demand cannot be identified in advance.
+ Stations with high return rate cannot be identified in advance.
+ Relocation may not be important if return rate is high enough to fill the demand.

## Objectives

The objective is to create multivariate regression models capable of estimating the following

+ **Demand prediction:** Number of bikes needed at each individual station.
+ **Return prediction:** Number of bikes returned at each individual station.

#  Background

## Demand Prediction Models-Models

+ **Univariate Time Series: **
  + Autoregressive moving Average (ARMA)
  + Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average
(ARIMA)
+ **Multivariate Time Series: **
  + Deep Learning with LSTM
  + Random Forest.
  + Boosting Algorithms.

## Demand Prediction Models-Features

+ **Demographics:**
  + Wealth.
  + Average age.

+ **Community**

+ **Weather**

+ **Sliding Window Statistics:**
  + Standard deviations.
  + Averages.
  
NB: Weather is especially important. BIXI BSS in Montreal is not operational in unfavorable weather, typically in mid-November to April.

# Dataset

## Lyft/Baywheels

The data was provided by Lyft, the owner of the BSS company Baywheels (formally GoBike) operating in San Francisco Bay Area.

+ The data is available as far as 2017 before Lyft's acquisition of GoBike.
+ The data used however is limited to 2021 and 2022 because:
    + The disruption caused by the 2020 COVID pandemic.
    + Potential business growth gap between 2019 and 2021.

## Weather Data

+ Weather data is very relevant in determining the demand.
+ The weather data for San Francisco Bay Area is provided by Meteostat through a Python API.

## Dataset Description

### Size:

+ **Original Number of Trips:** 4744199 trips .
+ **Final Number of Trips:** 3855197 trips.
+ **Number Of Stations**: 535 
+ **Period:** From January 2021 to December 2022

### Relevant Columns:

+ Station Name (start/end)
+ Time (start/end)
+ Coordinates (start/end)
+ Ride ID

# Cleaning Process

## Cleaning Process

+ **Station Standardization:** 

    + Stations in a particular street don't always have the same coordinates.
    + Many stations don't have a standardized name or ID, making them unidentifiable.
    + **Solution To Reduce Data Loss**: 
        + Use a single coordinate for any identifiable stations.
        + Approximate the closest standard station to any trip.
        + If the closest station is less than 500 meters away, keep the trip, otherwise, drop.

## Cleaning Process

+ **Same Station Trip:**
    + Several trips usually take place in several minutes, with the end station being the same as start stations.
    + This could be a result of users trying out the system or changed minds.
    + To prevent redundancy, any same station trip with duration less than 4 minutes will be removed.
    
## Cleaning Process
+ **Clustering**:
  + Helps reduce weather data size by:
      + Approximating areas closest to each other.
      + Approximating the weather conditions for each cluster.
  + Separates the areas the BSS serves.

## Demand and Returns

**Definitions**

+ Demand: Number of trips starting at a particular station.
+ Returns: Number of trips ending at a particular station.
+ "Returns" does not indicate actual number of bikes available, but it indicates how many bikes finished their trips there, which when compared with demand should provide a good idea about the available bikes.
+ Therefore, demand will be the main focus, while returns will be taken as secondary.

## Demand
```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}

## Demand and Returns

## RMSE

There are several criteria that can calculate the RMSE:

+ Hourly Predictions: 1.4093 Bikes Error.
+ Overall Daily Predictions: 4.4659 Bikes Daily
+ Mean RMSE Hourly Per Station: 3.6386 Bikes hourly
